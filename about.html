            <h4>RVSKVV</h4>
            <p>RVSKVV, Gwalior was Established by Govt. of Madhya Pradesh vide ordinance No.4 of 2008 extraordinary
                Gazette No.507, dated 19th August 2008 and enacted as Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya
                Act, 2009 (Madhya Pradesh Act No.4 of 2009, dated 12th February 2009), the State Agriculture University
                (SAU), located in the city of Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, with its four Colleges of Agriculture, one
                College of Horticulture, five Zonal Agriculture Research Stations, four Regional Agriculture Research
                Stations, five Regional Research Stations, 24 All India Coordinated Research Projects, and 22 Krishi
                Vigyan Kendras spread over 26 districts of its jurisdiction, covering 6 agro-climatic zones for
                enhancing productivity, optimization of profit and sustainability of agricultural production systems and
                improving rural livelihood in the State of Madhya Pradesh. RVSKVV has identified key challenges and
                opportunities in the agriculture sector for the next three decades for developing an appropriate
                strategy and a roadmap to articulate role of RVSKVV in shaping the future of the Indian agricultural
                research for growth, development and equity of state and nation.<br><br>
                Since its inception in the year 2008, the university has been growing with respect to the development of
                infrastructure, education, research and agricultural extension activities. A comparison of the present
                status with the early days gives us great satisfaction in terms of its all-round development and in the
                dynamic world the university is trying to become well equipped to venture to take on the new
                responsibility of agricultural development in the State particularly in northern and western regions of
                the State. The constituent units comprising different colleges, Zonal Research Stations, Regional
                Research Stations and KVKs have good reputation as they have been bestowed upon with infrastructure and
                highly qualified staff / faculty members. They have contributed significantly for the benefit of the
                farming community of the State. Due to notable achievements made earlier by the Alumni, specifically
                that of Colleges of Agriculture, Gwalior, Indore, Sehore, Khandwa and College of Horticulture, Mandsaur
                (now constituent units of RVSKVV), the university has distinct advantage. Further, more this University
                has strong linkages with ICAR and with international organizations and has also earned international
                reputation in the field of agricultural education and research, as evidenced by various collaborative
                programs. Such strength, cooperation and support can be secured for further development of this
                University. The innovative research and extension responsibilities the university has greater scope to
                initiate and coordinate research projects with other SAUs/ institutions of ICAR/CGIAR and secure greater
                integration for effective technology generation and dissemination, agribusiness development and
                entrepreneurship promotion.<Br><br>
                The agribusiness incubator CAIE has been created with initial funding of Rs. 7.0712 crores from NABARD
                with the staff to manage the Incubation Centre. Funds will be spent mainly to create pilot plant and
                basic infrastructure, salaries and other contingency etc. and the staff will identify the technologies
                that could potentially be commercialized to promote start-ups which are related to agriculture and
                allied sectors.<br><br>
                RVSABI gradually will be moved away from RVSKVV technology to a more client-centred approach. In order
                to engage scientists in CAIE work, management will encourage the scientific consulting, effectively
                putting scientists in contact with enterprises. CAIE business model will be evolved from fee-based
                (rental of infrastructure, office, and facilities) to offer feasibility studies and consulting services
                for promotion of start-ups as well as increasing the farm productivity by using the potential at
                utilization of Natural Resources and improved technologies.
